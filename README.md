This project aims to practice and apply various data manipulation techniques to analyze Petal Power's inventory. The focus is on working with DataFrames, selecting specific columns and rows, and performing operations using lambda functions to gain insights from the data. By the end of this project, the goal is to develop a deeper understanding of how to efficiently manipulate large datasets, automate calculations, and extract meaningful information to improve inventory management. This will help build foundational skills for more advanced data analysis tasks in the future.
